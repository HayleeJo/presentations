### Transitioning to Angular 2.0: TypeScript

This presentation was given on September 9 and the Rock Mountain AngularJS meetup. In it, we talk about what's coming in Angular 2, how TypeScript fits into the picture, and why building your Angular 1.x applications in TypeScript will make it easier to convert to Angular 2 when it is released.
